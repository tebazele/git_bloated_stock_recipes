# Classic Cherry Pie Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the Crust
- 2½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cubed
- ¼ to ½ cup ice water
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar

### For the Filling
- 5 cups fresh pitted cherries (or 2 cans/24oz of sour cherries in water, drained)
- 1 cup granulated sugar (¾ cup if using sweet cherries)
- ¼ cup cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- ¼ teaspoon almond extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

### For the Topping
- 1 egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon water (egg wash)
- 1 tablespoon coarse sugar

## Instructions

### Prepare the Crust
1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and sugar.
2. Add cold cubed butter and cut into the flour using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces.
3. Mix vinegar with ¼ cup ice water. Drizzle over the flour mixture and stir with a fork until the dough begins to come together. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed.
4. Divide the dough into two equal portions and form into disks. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.

### Prepare the Filling
1. In a large bowl, combine cherries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, almond extract, and salt. Stir gently until well mixed.
2. Let the mixture sit for about 15 minutes to allow the cherries to release their juices.

### Assemble and Bake
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any drips.
2. Roll out one disk of dough on a floured surface to a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a 9-inch pie dish.
3. Pour the cherry filling into the crust. Dot the top with small pieces of butter.
4. Roll out the second disk of dough and either cover the pie completely (cutting vents in the top) or create a lattice pattern.
5. Trim excess dough and crimp the edges to seal.
6. Brush the top crust with egg wash and sprinkle with coarse sugar.
7. Place the pie on the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.
8. Reduce temperature to 375°F (190°C) and continue baking for 35-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
9. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing to allow the filling to set.

## Serving Suggestions
Serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

## Storage
Cover leftover pie loosely with foil and store at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 4 days.
