# Classic Vanilla Ice Cream Recipe

## Ingredients
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- Pinch of salt
- 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise (or 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract)
- 6 large egg yolks

## Equipment
- Ice cream maker
- Medium saucepan
- Heatproof bowl
- Whisk
- Rubber spatula
- Storage container

## Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, milk, half the sugar, salt, and the vanilla bean (if using). Heat over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to steam but doesn't boil.

2. While the cream mixture is heating, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining sugar in a heatproof bowl until pale and slightly thickened.

3. Once the cream mixture is hot, remove the vanilla bean (if using). Slowly pour about 1 cup of the hot cream mixture into the egg yolks while whisking constantly. This tempers the eggs and prevents them from scrambling.

4. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture.

5. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of the spatula (about 170-175°F if using a thermometer).

6. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl. If using vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean, stir it in now.

7. Cover the custard with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight.

8. Pour the chilled custard into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually 20-25 minutes.

9. Transfer the soft ice cream to a storage container, press a piece of parchment paper directly on the surface, and seal with an airtight lid.

10. Freeze until firm, at least 4 hours.
