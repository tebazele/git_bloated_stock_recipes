# Classic BLT Sandwich Recipe

## Ingredients

- 8 slices thick-cut bacon
- 4 slices of your favorite bread (sourdough, white, or whole wheat work well)
- 1 large ripe tomato, sliced
- 4 leaves of crisp lettuce (romaine, iceberg, or butter lettuce)
- 2-3 tablespoons mayonnaise
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Optional Add-ons
- 1 ripe avocado, sliced
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- Red onion slices
- A few sprigs of fresh basil leaves

## Equipment
- Skillet or baking sheet
- Toaster
- Paper towels
- Knife
- Cutting board

## Instructions

1. **Cook the bacon**: 
   - For stovetop: Place bacon in a cold skillet, then turn heat to medium. Cook until crisp, turning occasionally, about 10-15 minutes.
   - For oven: Preheat to 400°F (200°C). Arrange bacon on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 15-20 minutes until desired crispness.
   - Transfer cooked bacon to paper towels to drain excess grease.

2. **Prepare vegetables**:
   - Wash and dry lettuce leaves.
   - Slice tomato into ¼-inch thick slices. Lightly salt the tomato slices to enhance flavor.
   - Prepare any optional add-ons.

3. **Toast the bread**:
   - Lightly toast the bread slices until golden brown.

4. **Assemble the sandwich**:
   - Spread mayonnaise evenly on one side of each bread slice.
   - Layer the bottom slice with lettuce leaves.
   - Add tomato slices on top of the lettuce.
   - Place bacon strips on top of the tomatoes, breaking them in half if needed to fit the bread.
   - Add any optional ingredients.
   - Top with the second slice of bread, mayonnaise side down.

5. **Slice and serve**:
   - Cut the sandwich diagonally for the classic presentation.
   - Serve immediately while the toast is still warm and bacon is crisp.

## Tips

- Use room temperature tomatoes for the best flavor.
- Pat the lettuce and tomato dry before assembling to prevent a soggy sandwich.
- For extra flavor, try toasting the bread in the bacon fat instead of a toaster.
- A light spread of butter on the bread before toasting adds richness.
- Classic BLTs are simple, but don't be afraid to experiment with add-ons!

## Variations

- BLAT: Add avocado slices for a California-style BLT.
- Club BLT: Add sliced turkey or chicken and an extra slice of bread for a triple-decker sandwich.
- Spicy BLT: Add a few thin slices of jalapeño or a spread of sriracha mayo.
